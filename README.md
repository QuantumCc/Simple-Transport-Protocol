APPROACHES:
Began by getting a basic understanding of the project from the starter code, recognized its difference from previous TCP transmission, which guided me how to implement both send and recv program. The send function I used initialize a packet buffer to store/track data that are out for transmission, it also uses timeout functionalities of timer to determine whether the eof has been received.

CHALLENGES:
Spent long time setting up the VM and looking for the starter code within it;
encountered trouble figuring out an efficient way to redeliver dropped packets;

TESTS:
I test my code using the net tests provided within the starter code, started from the very friendly to advanced.
